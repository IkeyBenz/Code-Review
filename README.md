# Code-Review
> A more efficient way to get your code peer reviewed, and yourself unblocked.

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8023ca091ec549aeb57977cdb8cc1879)](https://app.codacy.com/app/IkeyBenz/Code-Review?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=IkeyBenz/Code-Review&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

**The Problem:** Software engineers spend 75% of their time debugging. On average, that equates to roughly 1,500 hours per year. In the US alone, $113B is spent aunnually on identifying and fixing product defects. If coders spent less time getting/being blocked, a lot more could get done in smaller timeframes!

**The Solution: Utilizing other people's knowlege**, to speed up the going from *blocked* to *unblocked*, process will greatly increase your code output and make your life so much easier! Websites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [Experts Exchange](https://www.experts-exchange.com) are noteable for aiding in this process.

**The Caveat:** Explaining a problem with your code to someone on your team is *much* easier than explaining it to **randoms** who have **no background knowlege of your project**. BUT **meeting with teammates** every time you get blocked **takes too much time.**

>Code-Review aims to **combine the convenience** of posting code questions online, **with the effectiveness** of asking the question to someone on your team.
